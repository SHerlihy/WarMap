    "180": "Mr. Scratch (real name: N/A) is a homonculus who, eons ago, was tasked with protecting ancient secrets in a temple of mages.  They are all dead now.  Once a trapped soul powering a walking killing machine, he has wrested control from the now defunct automation that has been in place for several millenia, but only through a fluke involving a stuffed toy that looks a little like him.  Seeing similarities in the Pyre that remind him of his cruel origins, he has thrown his lot in with the Bastion to try and prevent a fate like his.\r\n...He is also learning that two millenia of killing experience counts for jack SH** around here.  After being bested in a swamp, losing some parts to wild swamp creatures, and being on the receiving end of artillary, all pervious assumptions he had about the situation have been thrown out the window.  And to top it all off, his body is changing in ways that nobody could have anticipated.  AND NOW, the toy is now talking to him, goading him and doubting him.  Just great."
